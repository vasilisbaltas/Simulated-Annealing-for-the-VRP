# Simulated-Annealing-for-the-VRP

This repository deals with the Vehicle Routing Problem.
More specifically, the aim is to help Santa Claus, during New Year's Eve, to deliver all the presents across the earth.
And to do so, I tried to minimize the objective function which was the reindeers' weariness, or fuel consumption in a more scientific way. This problem formulation
resembles an older Kaggle problem.

I have implemented a random search algorithm, as well as the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic combined with two different neighborhood moves.
